## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
#### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/stat3m3nt/geosnap-field-reporter.git
cd geosnap-field-reporter
```

#### 2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
#### 3. Start the development server
```
npx expo start
```

## ▶️ Running the App
### Option 1: Android Device (Recommended)
* Install Expo Go
* Scan the QR code
### Option 2: Android Emulator
* Install Android Studio
* Create an emulator
* Run:
```
npx expo start
```
* Press a

  
## ⚠️ Known Limitations
* Map does not work on web (react-native-maps is mobile-only)
* Expo Go may show blank maps on newer SDK versions (SDK 55 issue)
* Works best on:
  * Android device
  * Android emulator / development build
    
## 🧠 Design Decisions
* Context API used for lightweight global state management
* Custom hooks (useCreateReport, useCurrentLocation) used for separation of concerns
* Modular structure for scalability and maintainability
  
## 🐞 Challenges & Fixes
#### 1. Map Not Rendering
* Cause: Expo Go + SDK 55 + react-native-maps issue
* Fix: Tested using emulator / development build
  
#### 2. Location Permissions
* Handled using expo-location
* Graceful fallback with alerts
  
#### 3. Camera Integration
* Managed async permission flow
* Ensured camera readiness before capture
  
#### 4. Android Environment Setup
* Required manual setup of:
  * ANDROID_HOME
  * platform-tools in PATH
* Resolved adb not recognized issue
  
## 📈 Future Improvements
* Backend integration (Firebase / Node.js)
* Persistent storage (AsyncStorage or database)
* Real-time sync
* User authentication
* Improved UI/UX animations
* Web-compatible map implementation
